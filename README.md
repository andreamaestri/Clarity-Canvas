# Standardized Hackathon Readme

## Project Overview
This project was developed during a hackathon hosted by [Code Institute in November 2024](https://hackathon.codeinstitute.net/hackathon/53/). The goal was to come up with an idea for an app which helps people with accessibility needs. We were allowed to use any technology that we felt was necessary. 

Our project, **Clarity Canvas**, is an online whiteboard intended for collaborative work and brainstorming sessions. It offers a simplified digital workspace that optimises focus, with features for time management and organization. Our project was aimed at users with ADHD, who would benefit from being able to manage how stimulating their online work environment was. 

> could talk more about the requirements of users with ADHD here? 

## Features
**[Flex Mode / Focus Mode]**
The user is able to toggle between Flex Mode and Focus Mode depending on the level of stimulation they need to optimize their focus. In Flex Mode, more features are available (including a coin flipper, timer, and to-do list) and the workspace is more colourful. In Focus Mode, features are stripped back to only the essentials, and the colours are slightly dulled. This way, if a user needs to de-clutter their digital space, they can do so simply by toggling between modes.

## User Stories

> To be reviewed
**Setup and Customisation User Stories:**
As a new user, I want to be prompted with an initial setup screen
so that I can quickly customise my workspace with options like font size, mode selection (focus or normal), and colour scheme.
As a user, I want to choose between two modes: “Focus Mode” (low stimulation) and “Normal Mode” (high-medium stimulation)
so that the workspace environment can match my current focus needs.
As a user, I want to select a colour scheme from an accessible palette
so that my contributions are visually distinct and the interface is comfortable for my eyes.
As a user, I want to customise the initial set of widgets available on my workspace
so that I can start with tools that best support my focus and productivity.

**Central Whiteboard User Stories:**
As a user, I want a central whiteboard space that fills most of the screen
so that I can focus on my work without unnecessary distractions.
As a user, I want each participant’s contributions to be color-coded
so that I can easily identify who added what content.
As a user, I want a simple and uncluttered layout with all widgets and tools in one panel
so that I can access what I need quickly without feeling overwhelmed.

**Focus and Stimulation Mode Features:**
As a user in Focus Mode, I want a simplified, minimal interface with muted colours
so that I can maintain concentration without overstimulation.
As a user in Normal Mode, I want to access additional features like white noise generation (office sounds, rain, etc.)
so that I can create a background environment that helps me stay engaged.
As a user, I want to easily switch between Focus Mode and Normal Mode
so that I can adapt my workspace based on my current focus needs.

**Widget Features:**
As a user, I want a Pomodoro timer widget
so that I can work in focused intervals with automatic break reminders.
As a user, I want an optional basic timer widget
so that I can set custom intervals and reminders for breaks.
As a user, I want a Yes/No coin flipper widget
so that I can make quick decisions without overthinking.
As a user, I want a simple task-tracker/prioritiser widget
so that I can keep track of my tasks and focus on priorities.
As a user, I want a sticky notes widget
so that I can jot down quick ideas or reminders without leaving the whiteboard space.
As a user, I want a customisable focus timer with adjustable intervals
so that I can set work and break periods that match my preferred productivity rhythm.

**Collaboration Features:**
As a user, I want to receive subtle notifications when a collaborator adds content
so that I stay informed about changes without losing focus.
As a user, I want to see a session summary at the end of each collaboration
so that I can review the main points and contributions made during the session.
As a user, I want each collaborator’s contributions to be marked with their assigned color
so that I can easily distinguish between users’ inputs.

**Accessibility and Ease of Use Features:**
As a user, I want to be able to dock, rearrange, or hide widgets in my workspace
so that I can organize my tools in a way that feels intuitive and reduces visual clutter.
As a user, I want an auto-save feature that stores my work and a restore option when I return
so that I don’t lose progress if I get distracted or need to step away.
As a user, I want to enable optional audio or visual cues for reminders to refocus
so that I can stay on task with gentle prompts.
As a user, I want keyboard accessibility for key features (e.g., starting the timer, toggling focus mode, submitting tasks)
so that I can easily navigate and interact with the app without needing a mouse.

**MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Features:**
As a user, I want a basic central whiteboard with real-time updates and colour-coded contributions
so that I can collaborate with others effectively from the start.
As a user, I want a settings screen with options for font size, mode selection, and colour scheme
so that I can adjust the interface to my preferences quickly.
As a user, I want a toggle button for Focus Mode
so that I can simplify the UI instantly when I need to concentrate.
As a user, I want to have at least a basic timer widget for managing break times
so that I can incorporate regular breaks into my workflow.
Stretch Features (Optional Add-ons for Future Iterations):
As a user, I want to integrate third-party tools like Google Calendar or Notion
so that I can synchronise my tasks and schedule with external productivity apps.
As a user, I want to have an “Attention Booster” widget that offers quick motivational prompts or tips
so that I can regain focus when I start feeling distracted.
As a user, I want to have access to a history log of all changes made on the whiteboard
so that I can review edits and contributions made over time.
